Great choice! Applying **AI techniques to a Tetris game** is a smart and engaging way to demonstrate understanding of multiple concepts like search, 

## 🧠 **AI-Powered Tetris Game Project Plan**

---

### ✅ **Project Title**

**"AI-Enhanced Tetris: Game Bot using Search, Optimization, and Machine Learning"**

---

### 🎯 **Problem Statement**

Design and implement an AI system that autonomously plays Tetris with the goal of maximizing score. The project will apply AI techniques such as **heuristic search**, **genetic algorithms**, and optionally **reinforcement learning**, simulating decision-making under real-time constraints.

### 🧰 **Applied AI Concepts from Course**

| AI Concept             | Application in Tetris                                     |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Search Algorithms**  | Evaluate possible placements using greedy or A\* search   |
| **Optimization**       | Use Genetic Algorithm to evolve heuristic weights         |
| **Machine Learning**   | Train a model (optional: Q-Learning) to improve decisions |
| **Adversarial Search** | (Optional) Add a second AI to increase game complexity    |

### 🧩 **Methodology**

#### 1. **Game Environment**

* Tetris logic implemented in Python or JavaScript.
* Real-time piece dropping, rotation, and collision detection.

#### 2. **AI Decision-Making Logic**

* **Heuristic Evaluation Function**: Score each move based on:

  * Number of lines cleared
  * Aggregate height
  * Holes
  * Bumpiness
* **Search-based Bot**:

  * Simulate all possible placements of current and next tetromino.
  * Choose the one with the best heuristic score.

#### 3. **Genetic Algorithm (Optimization)**

* Evolve the weights of heuristic features.
* Chromosome = \[w1, w2, w3, w4] (weights for height, holes, lines cleared, bumpiness).
* Fitness = average score over N games.

#### 4. **(Optional) Reinforcement Learning**

* Use Q-learning or Deep Q-Network (DQN) to learn from experience.
